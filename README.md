# THIS PACKAGE IS THE MODIFIED VERSION OF [markdown-to-txt](https://github.com/ejrbuss/markdown-to-txt) BY [Eric Buss](https://github.com/ejrbuss), YOU MUST GO TO THEIR OFFICIAL [DOCUMENTATION](https://github.com/ejrbuss/markdown-to-txt#readme) RATHER THAN HERE. THE REASON I REPUBLISH THIS PACKAGE IS BECAUSE I NEED TO PORT THE CODEBASE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENT OF MY PRIVATE PROJECT.
